### react fragments

we need a wrapper. So if we wrap it using div then there will be many unnecessary divs will be there in that one index file. And there is chance of styling get effected in unwanted way.

So to avoid this, there is a wrapper concept in React. Basically we can wrap the components with <React.fragment></React.fragment> or simply <></>
